**Project: IQ Tools Self-Trading Machine Independent Bot**

**Studying Data Source and Extracting Information**
During my recent project, I developed an IQ Tools self-trading machine independent bot. As part of the project, 
I delved into the website's data source to understand the origin of the graphs' data. Through analysis, 
I discovered that the data was not fetched through a repeated link but rather via a web socket. 
Extracting and comprehending data from an external system presented challenges. However, after a day of studying, 
I successfully analyzed all the required information. I identified the relevant reply messages for the USD/GBP currency pair, 
determined their IDs, and grasped the functionality of each parameter in the replies, such as min, max, start, from, and end. 
Armed with this knowledge, I developed my own client-side bot using Node.js and initiated message exchanges with the server.

**Overcoming Initial Hurdles and Achieving Functionality**
At the outset, I encountered an issue where the IQ Option server failed to send me the desired pair messages. 
After meticulously studying hundreds of messages, I eventually uncovered the specific message that needed to be sent to the server to elicit the desired response. 
Once implemented, my website clients started receiving the expected messages.

**Algorithm Development and Testing**
In addition to data retrieval, I created an algorithm to analyze candle breaks and their preceding values on the graph. 
Another algorithm I developed involved monitoring predefined patterns and promptly detecting their occurrence. Upon identification, 
the bot had the potential to trigger automatic buy or sell actions. However, I did not enable this feature in the bot. To assess the system's performance, 
I utilized cookies from a real user's test account for my server-based IQ Option bot. Consequently, 
the same account was active in both my bot and the actual platform.

**Live Status Monitoring and Analysis**
To keep track of the bot's live status, I set up a continuous running script and designed an online webpage where the bot acted as the server. 
Clients could observe real-time analysis on this webpage.

**Teacher's Project and Discontinuation**
Initially, this project was intended for one of my teachers who, unfortunately, did not possess reliable patterns and was experimenting with unreliable ones. 
This lack of consistency made it impractical for him to monitor the bot continuously for 24 hours. Seeking my assistance, he approached me, 
and I completed the project within a span of 3-4 days. 
However, I soon realized that his absence of a suitable pattern was consuming my time without yielding substantial results. Consequently, 
I made the decision to discontinue my involvement in the project.
